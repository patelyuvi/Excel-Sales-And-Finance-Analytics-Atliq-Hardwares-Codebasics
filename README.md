# Excel-Based Sales & Financial Analytics – AtliQ Hardware (Codebasics Project)

## 🧠 Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a leading global provider of PCs, printers, and computer accessories, was facing challenges in optimizing sales performance and improving profit margins. With fragmented Excel reports from various regional managers, gaining cohesive and actionable insights had become a hurdle.

This is where a data-driven approach using Excel analytics came into play.

## 🎯 Objective

As a Data Analyst, my role was to transform scattered and raw data into structured insights. The dataset, containing over **500,000+ unorganized records**, demanded significant cleaning and structuring (ETL processes). The core objective was to extract meaningful KPIs and performance trends that could help leadership make smarter, faster business decisions—especially around **net sales** and **gross margin optimization**.
